## 1. Information We Collect  
**GUILD-BOT** stores your **Discord User ID** only for the purpose of tracking whether you have already seen the initial notice.  
This ensures you donâ€™t repeatedly see the same prompt and improves your experience.

Your Discord ID is used **exclusively** for managing the first-time notice system.  
We do **not** collect, log, or process any other personal information.

## 3. Data Sharing  
**GUILD-BOT** does **not** sell, share, or disclose your information to any third parties.

## 4. Cookies and Tracking  
The Bot does **not** use cookies, analytics tools, or other tracking technologies.  

---

## 5. Data Deletion and Access  
Because we only keep your Discord ID temporarily for user notice functionality, and no other personal data is stored,  
there is no need for data deletion or export requests.  
If you have concerns, you may still reach out to us.

## 6. Paid Services  
**GUILD-BOT** is a free service and does not provide paid features or subscriptions.

- This only happens in public channels like `#tag` or `#info`.  
- No message content is stored, logged, or shared.  
- This process is optional and can be disabled by the server owner at any time.
